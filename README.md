# Mockito-ShopService

The main types of test you can perform with Mockito are as follows:

+ Mocking: You can create simulated objects (mocks) to simulate the behavior of dependencies. 
This allows you to test a class in isolation from its dependencies.

+ Verification: You can check whether certain methods have been called on simulated objects and with the appropriate arguments. 
This ensures that your code interacts correctly with its dependencies.

+ Stubbing: You can define behaviors for methods on simulated objects to return specific values.
This allows you to control the behavior of dependencies in your tests.

+ Argument Capturing: You can capture arguments passed to a method on a simulated object 
to check them or use them later in your tests.

+ Spying: You can create spies, which are real objects with partial simulation functionality. 
This allows you to test one part of a real object while preserving the real behavior of its other parts.


These types of tests allow you to test different interactions and behaviors in your code using Mockito. 
You can combine them to create complete and exhaustive tests for your classes.
